# LPWAN Server (lpwanserver)

The LPWAN Server is the backend CableLabs' [LPWAN Server](http://lpwanserver.com/)
project. It is a Node.js REST server that sits above a set of LPWANs that may
employ differing LPWAN technologies and may be owned by one or more LPWAN
operators. The LPWAN Server provides a unified interface across LPWAN
technologies and/or operators as a single interface to Low Power WAN (LPWAN)
application vendors. It collects the data generated by the devices, and forwards
that data to a server for the application.

The LPWAN Server project aslo provides a rich web application. The
[LPWAN Server Web Client](https://github.com/cablelabs/lpwanserver-web-client)
is the user interface that allows for easy management of LPWAN applications and
devices via a web browser, across all LPWAN networks associated with the system.
